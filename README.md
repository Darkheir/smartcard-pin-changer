### About IAIK PKCS#11 Wrapper

#### Description

This is a library for the Java™ platform which makes PKCS#11 (also known as Cryptoki) modules accessible from within Java™. A PKCS#11 module is a software library with a defined API which allows access to cryptographic hardware. It usually comes with hardware security modules (HSM), smart cards and crypto tokens (e.g. USB tokens). Thus, the PKCS#11 Wrapper provides Java™ software access to almost any crypto hardware. For example, a Java™ application can use it to integrate a HSM or a smart card to create digital signatures, to decrypt data or to unwrap keys.
